# nets213-final-project

This should follow the schematic you created for your final project flow diagram. It should also indiciate what the high level milestones for each component are. To make sure you understand the complexity of your own project, each component should have a point value between (1-4) outlining the amount of work required to implement that section. A project suitable for this class should have between 15 - 20 points overall. In your Project update meeting the staff will help you redistribute point values.
